# searching-codebases - Changelog

All notable changes to the `searching-codebases` skill are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-04

### Other

- searching-codebases 2.2.0: narrow to binding-resolved edge case (#722)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Repositioned the skill as edge-case: the binding-resolved Python tier
  (`--refs`/`--def`/`--hover`) is the one recommended use. Frontmatter
  description and When-to-Use rewritten accordingly.
- Empirical basis: head-to-head localization eval on 7 scikit-learn issues
  with merged fix-PRs (replicating the file-discovery metric of
  arXiv:2602.11988). Indexed-regex and TF-IDF semantic tiers tied or lost
  vs naive rg on every instance at 4-60x wall-clock; semantic never won,
  including on identifier-poor issues (~0.3% of merged-PR traffic).
- Tiers remain functional; they carry the burden of proof.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- open all symbol-bearing files for the binding-resolved tier (#698)
- auto-install tree-sitter for the binding-resolved tier

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- add treesit.py CLI, fix cross-process cache loss, fix Symbol dict bug (#536)

### Other

- searching-codebases: binding-resolved Python tier via python-lsp (#695) (#697)
- Remove _MAP.md files, direct agents to tree-sitting for code navigation (#545)
- Add missing READMEs for searching-codebases, featuring, tree-sitting (#521)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Binding-resolved reference/definition tier for Python via the `python-lsp` skill (pyright): `--refs`, `--def`, `--hover` (#695)
  - `--refs SYMBOL` excludes same-named-but-unrelated symbols and follows imports — the precision the regex cross-reference tier lacks
  - Engaged lazily (pyright index cost paid only on these flags); Python-only with a mandatory soft fallback to the regex text path (non-`.py`, or pyright/node absent) that emits a one-line degradation note
  - `scripts/lsp_refs.py`: tree-sitting symbol→position resolution, 1-based↔0-based conversion at the LSP boundary, lifecycle-safe queries (index-wait + subprocess reaping)
  - `tests/test_lsp_refs.py`: binding-resolution, import-following, indexing-wait determinism, no orphaned subprocess, and soft-fallback coverage
