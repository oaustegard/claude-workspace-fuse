# tree-sitting - Changelog

All notable changes to the `tree-sitting` skill are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- persistent scan-cache (0.7.0) (#732)

### Other

- tree-sitting: note tree-sitter v0.26.10 is core-only (no Python binding yet) (#719)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Persistent filesystem scan-cache: scans are cached to disk, keyed on fileset fingerprint (mtime + size of all candidate files, combined with skip-set and cache format version). Auto-invalidates when files change, are added, or removed. Atomic writes prevent corrupt cache files. Cache hits return byte-identical results vs. fresh parse. New flags: `--no-cache` (disable cache), `--rebuild-cache` (force rewrite). New env var: `TREESIT_CACHE_DIR` to relocate cache from system temp.

### Changed

- Workflow guidance: batched multi-query drills are now the default approach for structural exploration. Users should combine `find:`, `source:`, and `refs:` queries in a single invocation instead of separate calls. Added explicit note NOT to fall back to grep/sed for symbol structure lookups.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-17

### Other

- tree-sitting v0.6.0: bundle Mojo grammar, retire rename-to-.py workaround (#654)
- tree-sitting: pin language-pack <1.6.3 in fallback install hint (#579)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Bundled Mojo grammar (`parsers/libtree_sitter_mojo.so`) built from [`oaustegard/tree-sitter-mojo`](https://github.com/oaustegard/tree-sitter-mojo) @ `1fe537c` (post-v1.0, 78/78 corpus + 29/29 acceptance suite passing). Registers `.mojo` and `.🔥` in `EXT_TO_LANG` and adds a tags.scm entry mirroring the grammar's own `queries/tags.scm` (structs/classes → class, traits → interface, `fn` → function or method depending on nesting, alias → constant, var → variable). Retires the rename-to-`.py` workaround documented in Muninn memory `77cf6b41`. Smoke-tested on a 31-file Mojo corpus: 982 symbols in 54ms.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-24

### Other

- tree-sitting: drop tree_sitter_language_pack, load bundled .so directly (fixes #572) (#573)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Drop `tree-sitter-language-pack` dependency (#572). The 1.6.x wheels install into `_native/` with no top-level package directory, making imports fail in Claude.ai containers. Even if the import is patched, the pack tries to download grammars at runtime from a domain outside the network allowlist. Grammars are now loaded directly from bundled `parsers/*.so` via `ctypes`, against the bare `tree-sitter` package (which installs cleanly). Setup is simpler (no venv) and install is ~1s.

### Changed

- Setup command is now `uv pip install --system --break-system-packages tree-sitter` — no venv required.
- Supported-languages list narrowed to the 11 bundled grammars (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX, Go, Rust, Ruby, Java, C, HTML, Markdown). Previously advertised languages without bundled parsers silently returned empty before this change anyway; now they're documented honestly with instructions for adding a grammar.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Other

- tree-sitting: show line ranges in sparse/normal tree overviews (#568)
- Remove _MAP.md files, direct agents to tree-sitting for code navigation (#545)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Tree overview now shows `:start-end` line ranges per symbol in `sparse` and `normal` detail levels, not just `full`. The default orientation output (used by `exploring-codebases` step 2) becomes actionable: pick a symbol's line window and feed it directly to `Read` via `offset`/`limit` without a second treesit call.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- add treesit.py CLI, fix cross-process cache loss, fix Symbol dict bug (#536)

### Other

- marketplace: restructure as category-based plugins for Claude Code discovery (#530)
- Add missing READMEs for searching-codebases, featuring, tree-sitting (#521)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- tree-sitting v0.2.0 — AST navigation + tags.scm extraction (#511)
