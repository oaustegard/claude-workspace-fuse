# reading-business-cards - Changelog

All notable changes to the `reading-business-cards` skill are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-10-07

### Other

- Migrate hardcoded model defaults to the 5.5 generation

## [2.3.0] - 2026-10-07

### Changed

- `extract_cards.py` defaults to `claude-haiku-5-5` (was `claude-haiku-4-5`); docs use
  `claude-sonnet-5-5` for the escalation run. The Haiku-vs-Sonnet accuracy findings
  were measured on the 4.x models and have not been re-measured.
- `prep_cards.py` comments name tier families instead of 4.x generations (the floors
  are keyed by tier name, not model id).

### Fixed

- `temperature: 0` is only sent to legacy model families; Haiku 5.5 and Sonnet 5.5
  return HTTP 400 for it.
- `max_tokens` raised from 1500 to 4096 because adaptive thinking on 5.x models
  counts against it and could leave the JSON truncated.
