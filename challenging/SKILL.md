# Challenging — Adversarial Review

Adversarial review before shipping. Three paths, each with distinct trade-offs:

- **Subagent path** (Claude Code, primary). Native sub-Claude via the Task tool — zero API keys, fresh context window, same model. Best when available.
- **External API path** (claude.ai, Codex, headless). Gemini (cross-model + cross-context) or Anthropic API (cross-context). Costs an incremental API call but gives genuine outside perspective.
- **Self path** (any environment). The caller assistant inhabits the adversary persona in a dedicated response. Zero cost, retains full subject-matter context from the conversation. Weaker at catching same-session confabulations than fresh-context adversaries, stronger at catching local-convention and factual errors the artifact glosses over. Not a strict downgrade — a different failure-mode profile.

The `adversary='auto'` resolution (default) picks gemini → claude → self based on available credentials. Callers in Claude Code still use `prepare()` + Task tool explicitly (subagent is strictly better than self in that environment, and auto-detection of Claude Code is brittle).

Inspired by VDD (dollspace.gay) and Grainulation's anti-rationalization patterns. The `drill` helper adopts the 5 Whys pattern from Tim Kellogg's [open-strix writeup](https://timkellogg.me/blog/2026/04/14/forgetting). The self-path persona-inhabitation move is kin to generative-thinking's inversion — commit to the mode before evaluating.

## Profiles

Pick the profile matching your artifact. **Read only the profile you need** — each is self-contained with persona, anti-rationalization table, evaluation criteria, and adversary system prompt.

| Profile | Use For | Iteration strategy | File |
|---------|---------|--------------------|------|
| `prose` | Blog posts, essays, articles — generic prose competence | parallel replay | `references/prose.md` |
| `prose-register` | Prose with a *named voice signature* — fidelity check | parallel replay | `references/prose-register.md` |
| `analysis` | Research briefs, comparisons, synthesis | parallel replay | `references/analysis.md` |
| `code` | Scripts, implementations, PRs | parallel replay | `references/code.md` |
| `recommendation` | Technical decisions, architecture choices | parallel replay | `references/recommendation.md` |
| `philosophers` | Arguments, position pieces, design rationales — conceptual-layer audit | parallel replay | `references/philosophers.md` |
| `drill` | 5 Whys on one finding from a review | sequential deepen | `references/drill.md` |

One engine, one surface, two iteration strategies. Review profiles iterate in *parallel replay* — each pass independent, novelty tracked for confabulation. Drill iterates in *sequential deepen* — each pass takes the chain so far and produces one more why-level until bedrock or max depth, followed by a synthesis pass that extracts root causes.

`philosophers` and `analysis` are complements on argument-heavy artifacts: `analysis` audits the evidentiary layer (source independence, cherry-picking, calibration); `philosophers` audits the conceptual layer via Socratic elenchus and Aristotelian division (definitional stability, inference validity, is/ought slippage, taxonomy-before-verdict). An artifact can pass one and fail the other.

`prose` and `prose-register` are siblings, not redundant. `prose` evaluates generic prose competence (claims, logic, structure, performed insight) and is explicitly told not to comment on style. `prose-register` evaluates fidelity to a named voice signature passed via `voice=...` (positive markers + anti-patterns) and ignores generic competence. Run both passes on voiced prose — they catch different failure modes.

## Usage — Claude Code (subagent path, primary)

Two-step protocol: a Python helper builds the prompt, you spawn a subagent via the Task tool, then a parser turns its response into structured findings.

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/mnt/skills/user/challenging/scripts')
from challenger import prepare, parse_response

job = prepare(
    artifact=open('/home/claude/draft.md').read(),
    profile='prose',
    context='Blog post about RAG scaling laws',
)
```

Then invoke the Task tool — `subagent_type='general-purpose'`, `prompt=job['prompt']`, `description='Adversarial review (prose)'`. The subagent runs in a fresh context, applies the persona, and returns a JSON message. Pass that message text to the parser:

```python
result = parse_response(subagent_text)
print(result['verdict'])    # SHIP | REVISE | RETHINK
print(result['findings'])   # List of specific issues
print(result['strengths'])  # What to preserve
```

**Why subagents (not the API):** no key, no network dependency, fresh context, and the same Claude that's reviewing your work is reviewing it again with no prior bias — but in a clean window. For cross-model diversity (genuinely different blind spots), use Gemini below.

### Voiced prose — `prose-register` (subagent path)

For prose written in a named voice, `prose` will miss register-specific failure modes by design (its persona is instructed not to comment on style). Use the `prose-register` profile with a `voice=...` signature instead — or in addition, since the two profiles target orthogonal failure modes.

```python
voice = """
Corvid voice signature.
Positive markers: short sentences when certainty is high, dry observations,
lead with the answer then context, no throat-clearing.
Anti-patterns: heroic-narrator framing, drama-line-breaks ("Then the part that
almost killed it." floating alone), cliche tells ("shot itself in the foot",
"footgun"), time-scale inflation ("a month ago" when it was yesterday),
performed-significance setups ("What's interesting about this is..."),
RTFM-performed-as-revelation, precious sentimentality in closings.
"""

job = prepare(
    artifact=open('/home/claude/draft.md').read(),
    profile='prose-register',
    context='Blog post for muninn.austegard.com',
    voice=voice,
)
# Task tool → parse_response() as usual.
```

`voice` is required for `prose-register` and rejected for every other profile — pass the signature once, fail loud if it leaks to the wrong call. The richer the signature (with both positive markers and explicit anti-patterns), the more precise the review. A thin signature returns `verdict: RETHINK` with a finding describing what to sharpen rather than a confident review against an ambiguous spec.

### Drill — 5 Whys on a systemic finding (subagent path)

Drill uses the same `prepare()` / Task / `parse_response()` protocol as review profiles, but you run the loop yourself — each pass takes the chain so far and produces exactly ONE new `{why, because}`. When the adversary sets `bedrock=true` (or you hit max depth), run a final synthesis pass.

```python
from challenger import prepare, parse_response

suspect = next(f for f in result['findings'] if f['severity'] in ('high', 'critical'))
artifact = open('/home/claude/draft.md').read()
ctx = 'Blog post about RAG scaling laws'

chain = []
for depth in range(1, 6):
    job = prepare(artifact, 'drill', context=ctx, finding=suspect, chain=chain)
    # Task tool: subagent_type='general-purpose', prompt=job['prompt']
    step = parse_response(subagent_text)   # {why, because, bedrock, reasoning}
    chain.append({'why': step['why'], 'because': step['because']})
    if step.get('bedrock'):
        break

# Final synthesis pass over the completed chain
job = prepare(artifact, 'drill', context=ctx, finding=suspect, chain=chain, synthesize=True)
# Task tool again, then:
diagnosis = parse_response(subagent_text)
print(diagnosis['chain'])        # [{why, because}, ...]
print(diagnosis['root_causes'])  # usually 3-4 distinct systemic issues
print(diagnosis['direction'])    # compass heading for the process fix
```

`finding` accepts either a dict from `parse_response()` or a free-text description. Patches fix the instance; drills fix the class. Why sequential, not parallel? A single-shot drill lets the model shortcut the whole tree and produces renames instead of explanations; one level per pass forces each "because" to earn its depth. See `references/drill.md` for when to drill and the anti-patterns to reject.

## Usage — claude.ai, Codex, headless scripts (API path)

Where subagents aren't available, call an external model directly.

```python
from challenger import challenge

result = challenge(
    artifact=open('draft.md').read(),
    profile='prose',
    context='Blog post about RAG scaling laws',
    adversary='gemini',     # default — cross-model diversity
)
```

`adversary` accepts:
- **`auto`** (default) — resolves to gemini > claude > self based on available credentials. Logs the choice.
- **`gemini`** — Gemini 3.1 Pro. Cross-model + cross-context. Requires Gemini credentials.
- **`claude`** — Anthropic API. Cross-context, same model family. **Do not use this in Claude Code** — use the subagent path instead.
- **`self`** — NOT runnable via `challenge()` (raises with a pointer to `prepare_self()`). Self-challenge requires the caller assistant to produce the adversary response, which a synchronous function cannot do.

Drill uses the same `challenge()` call with `profile='drill'`. `challenge()` runs the whole sequential-deepen loop internally and returns the synthesized diagnosis:

```python
diagnosis = challenge(
    artifact,
    profile='drill',
    context=ctx,
    finding=suspect,          # required for drill
    max_iterations=5,         # optional — defaults to 5 for drill, 3 for review
)
print(diagnosis['chain'], diagnosis['root_causes'], diagnosis['direction'])
```

### Blocking mode (API path, review profiles only)

```python
result = challenge(artifact, profile='analysis', mode='blocking', max_iterations=3)
```

Loops the adversary until: (a) no actionable findings, (b) novelty rate > 75% (adversary inventing problems — artifact is clean), or (c) max iterations. `mode` is ignored when `profile='drill'` — drill always iterates until bedrock or max depth. Subagent-path callers can replicate blocking mode by looping `prepare()` / Task / `parse_response()` themselves and tracking findings across iterations.

## Usage — self path (same-context adversary)

When neither subagents nor external API credentials are available — or when subject-matter context from the current conversation is load-bearing for the review — use `prepare_self()`. The caller assistant inhabits the adversary persona in a dedicated response.

```python
from challenger import prepare_self, parse_response

job = prepare_self(
    artifact=open('draft.md').read(),
    profile='analysis',
    context='Cross-domain claim that depends on codebase-specific IEEE-754 conventions',
)
# job is {'system': <adversary system prompt>, 'user': <artifact + context>, ...}
```

The caller then:
1. Reads `job['system']` — the prompt opens with `SELF-INVOCATION MODE` instructing a full persona switch. Commit to it.
2. In a dedicated response, produces JSON matching the schema described in the system prompt.
3. Passes that JSON string to `parse_response()`.

```python
# After generating the adversary JSON in a dedicated response:
result = parse_response(adversary_json_text)
print(result['verdict'], result['findings'])
```

**When self beats external:** the artifact depends on conventions visible only from inside the conversation (codebase invariants, prior decisions, domain terminology established earlier). External adversaries with generic priors issue confident-but-wrong findings in these cases; self retains the context.

**When external beats self:** the artifact contains confabulations or blind spots the caller already committed to. Fresh context catches these; self inherits them.

**When possible, run both.** They have orthogonal failure modes.

Drill via self path uses the same loop as the subagent drill: iterate `prepare_self(profile='drill', finding=..., chain=...)` — produce one `{why, because}` per dedicated response — append to chain — until bedrock or max depth — then a final synthesize pass.

## Verdicts

- **SHIP**: Clean. Deliver.
- **REVISE**: Real issues, sound core. Fix and deliver.
- **RETHINK**: Structural problems. Reconsider approach.

## Severity Levels

- **critical/high/medium/low**: Standard severity — actionable findings that block in blocking mode.
- **unverifiable**: Adversary flagged something it doesn't recognize (API, pattern, model name) but can't confirm is wrong. Surfaced for awareness but does not block SHIP. Use `context` to ground the adversary on APIs/patterns it may not know.

## Credentials (API path only)

The subagent path needs no credentials. The API path loads from environment or project files:

- **Gemini via Cloudflare Gateway** (preferred): `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CF_GATEWAY_ID`, `CF_API_TOKEN` from env or `proxy.env`
- **Gemini direct**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from env
- **Claude API** (claude.ai fallback only): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `API_KEY` from env or `claude.env`

No external skill dependencies. `requests` is loaded lazily — only the API path requires it.
