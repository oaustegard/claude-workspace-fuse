# composing-html - Changelog

All notable changes to the `composing-html` skill are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-04

### Other

- composing-html v0.5.0: deterministic check command + rule anchors (#684)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- `build.py check <file.html>` — a deterministic structural linter (no model
  call, stdlib only) for built artifacts and body fragments. Calibrated to
  composing-html's actual failure modes: content that breaks *out* of the
  fixed design system (`hardcoded-color`, `inline-typography`,
  `undefined-token`) or miswires `base.js` hooks (`broken-tabs`,
  `broken-bind`, `broken-sortable`), plus `chrome-leak`, `nested-card`,
  `heading-skip`, `img-no-alt`. Error-severity rules set a non-zero exit code;
  `--json` for machine output; full-artifact vs fragment auto-detected
  (`--full` / `--fragment` to force). Contrast checking intentionally
  out of scope (token pairs are pre-vetted; regex can't judge custom pairs).
- `scripts/checker.py` module exposing `check_html()` / `format_findings()`.
- `tests/test_checker.py` — one fire/silent assertion pair per rule.
- SKILL.md: a "Checking output" section, and `<!-- rule:ID -->` anchors on the
  output rules tying each guidance line to its checker rule, so teaching and
  enforcement stay in sync. (Approach adapted from pbakaus/impeccable's
  rule-anchored guidance, retargeted from freehand-design taste to
  system-adherence + hook integrity.)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-21

### Other

- Revert #665 — move HTML routing out of composing-html (v0.4.1) (#666)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-21

### Removed

- "Sibling skill: Hallmark" routing section and the `austegard.com` /
  `muninn.austegard.com` exclusion clause added in 0.4.0. The routing
  decision (and the personal-site exclusions) is operator-specific and
  doesn't belong in a general-purpose skill. Moved to a separate router
  skill in `oaustegard/muninn-utilities` (`skills/designing-html/`).
- Description reverted to the 0.3.0 phrasing — no pointer at Hallmark or
  any external sibling skill.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-21

### Other

- composing-html: route ad-hoc HTML to Hallmark sibling skill (v0.4.0) (#665)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- SKILL.md "Sibling skill: Hallmark for greenfield ad-hoc HTML" section
  routing greenfield landing-page / audit / redesign / `study` briefs to
  the Hallmark skill at `oaustegard/fork-hallmark` (MIT, fork of
  `Nutlope/hallmark`). Includes a brief / use-which table and an explicit
  exclusion for `muninn.austegard.com` and `austegard.com` (established
  voices; composing-html and site-native templates handle them).
- Description updated to point ad-hoc HTML cases at the new section.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-20

### Other

- composing-html: --set escape hatch for body_html (fix multi-line JSON failure mode) (#657)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- `build.py build` now accepts `--set KEY=VALUE` and `--set KEY=@FILE` to
  assign or override spec fields from the command line. `@FILE` loads the
  file contents verbatim into the field, sidestepping JSON-string escaping
  for multi-line HTML / CSS / JS bodies. `--spec` is now optional when
  `--set` supplies every required field. `--set` overrides matching fields
  from `--spec`.
- Tests cover the new `--set` paths (inline values, file loads, override
  semantics, bad syntax, missing files) and end-to-end CLI invocation.

### Changed

- SKILL.md reframes the freeform workflow around `--set body_html=@body.html`
  as the recommended path for anything with a substantial body — the prior
  "write spec.json" instruction was prone to producing invalid JSON when
  models inlined multi-line HTML via heredoc. The spec-file path is now
  positioned as best-fit for templates with typed slots, where JSON earns
  its keep.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-09

### Other

- composing-html: lead with chrome + freeform; demote templates (#636) (#637)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- Reframe SKILL.md around chrome + `freeform` as the default workflow; demote templates to a "shortcuts for repeat structure" section. Surface the `references/palette.md` inventory (color tokens, type stacks, layout primitives, components, tabs/sortables/live-binds) inline in SKILL.md so it reads as the primary product, not an appendix (#636).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-09

### Other

- Add composing-html skill: progressive-disclosure HTML artifact composer (#634)
